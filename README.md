A description of which parts of the assignment you have accomplished and where you run into difficulties:
I ran into difficulties when doing multiplication for QQ arithmetic as well as Normalization
as I did not completely understand it conceptually. I attended the SI session and there I collaborated
with the SI and others to fix my multQ function. A challenging part was the syntax of multQ as well as
casting some of the types. I had a little bit of trouble casting types in general because I did not
understand the distinction between each of the types such as Integer vs Natural Number. I ran into
trouble implementing the abs function as I thought it was correct but it kept giving me errors. I
also implemented Subtraction, Modulo, Minus, Divide, Power, and Square.  


How you tested your programs:
I tested my program by adding test cases in main in arithmetic.hs and seeing if the output values are the values I expected. I also tested my calculator by performing basic order of operation functions and tested
all the new expressions I created.


What you learned:
I learned a lot about formatting and syntax in Haskell and how to make my own notation when implementing
functions and data types. I learned that when choosing multiplication and division I have freedom
to choose whatever characters we want to attach to a function. For example, when implementing my squared
function I chose to represent it with a $.

Interesting observations you made:
I thought it was interesting to learn about Haskell and working on my first project in Haskell.

How you connect the assignment with the theory:
I implemented a concrete and abstract syntax trees into practice and into a functioning calculator.
I did not think about how complex it is for a computer to implement basic addition and Subtraction.
